# 0xC1

0xC1 is a game that follows the idea behind Markus Person's ( Notch ) game : 0x10c
We're making it because Notch never released 0x10c, and abandonned it.


To-do :
- Basic render engine (Light and basic shapes)
- Basic physics ( AABB based )

After that :
- Basic ship construction
- Procedural generation for planets ( Mostly spheres with perlin noise heightmap )

Ideas for the future (Like, in a long time) :

- If we're crazy, computer programmation in game ( Custom script language )
- Various scales for ship, with a ranking system based on the ship's mass, the ranking systeme being use only for bragging purpose
- Planetary structures ( factories, mines etc... ) all handled by players
- Different group systems, with different sizes ( Solo player -> Group -> Guild / Faction -> Corporation -> Alliance ( multiple corporations ) ) 
       It would be fun to see a war between two alliances, lots of little guilds and corporation would get into it
